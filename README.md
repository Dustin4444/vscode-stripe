Stripe's extension for Visual Studio Code makes it easy to generate sample code, view API request logs, forward events to your application, and use Stripe within your editor.

A new Stripe panel in the activity bar provides easy access to code snippets for several languages, adds debug configurations, and extends the command palette with common developer workflows.
